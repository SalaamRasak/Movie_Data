# 🎬 Movie Data Analysis

Beyond screen time, insight matters! I crunched the numbers with Excel’s **Pivot Tables** and **Pivot Charts** to spill the cinematic tea.

## 📊 What I Did
- Calculated **Average Box Office Revenue**, **Average Budget**, and **Average Profit**.
- Ranked directors by **Average Revenue** in a descending order.
- Visualized it all for instant “wow” moments.

## 💡 Insights
- Some directors turn small budgets into big hits.
- Others burn cash like it’s popcorn.
- Profitability isn’t always about spending more.

## 🛠 Tools
- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Table + Pivot Chart + Calculated Fields)
